# Banner-Image-Manipulation
This is a small project I did for a client. The purpose of it was to alter a set image to be able to add a number and text to it whilst being expanable and allowing for multiple variations with difference sizes. At the request of the client I have had to remove the actual images used and replaced them with basic templates showing the locations at which the number and text appeared.
